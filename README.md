# Learning Representations by Recirculation
## Recirculation Algorithm

This is an implementation of an autoencoder using the recirculation algorithm from scratch. If you click on the "Open in Colab" icon, you'll be able to run it right away. Again, if it is your first time using google colab, on the top of the window from the options bar click on "Runtime" then scroll down and select "Run all", if you are going to restart the kernel, scroll down and select "Restart runtime" or "Restart and run all"
